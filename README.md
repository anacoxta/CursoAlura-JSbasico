### Sidenote
**Personally, I believe the only purpose BMI serves is to shame people into submitting to beauty standards. Even tough science has already proven it serves no function in detecting deseases, people still use BMI as a yardstick for health and penalize everyone deemed unhealthy by it. In other words: BMI is fatphobic. That's why I disliked doing this assignment.**
